In all the companies I have worked for they always hire me to solve problems and I am very good at that and when I finish solving they always assign me new 
projects which I always finish in a much shorter time than expected, I have dedicated my entire life to updating myself. forever better every day to be able 
to help international companies achieve their goals in this way I would reach mine.

That is why I am always updating myself and knowing the most current tools and programming languages ​​to always be at the forefront, of course I always wanted 
to be hired by an international company but I already saw that all companies are the same there is always someone who is concerned that one knows more than 
others and I don't blame them, it is difficult to be looking for new jobs since the people who interview you only see what happens in an interview and not what 
you have done and they don't even look at your CV thinking that they know what they want you answer but those same people who give you technical exams will also be 
in the same situation as you.
