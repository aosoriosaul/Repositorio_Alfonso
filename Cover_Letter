In all the companies I have worked for they always hire me to solve problems and I am very good at that and when I finish solving they always assign me new 
projects which I always finish in a much shorter time than expected, I have dedicated my entire life to updating myself. forever better every day to be able 
to help international companies achieve their goals in this way I would reach mine.

That is why I am always updating myself and knowing the most current tools and programming languages ​​to always be at the forefront, of course I always wanted 
to be hired by an international company but I already saw that all companies are the same there is always someone who is concerned that one knows more than 
others and I don't blame them, it is difficult to be looking for new jobs since the people who interview you only see what happens in an interview and not what 
you have done and they don't even look at your CV thinking that they know what they want you answer but those same people who give you technical exams will also be 
in the same situation as you.

I have more than 30 years working as a developer and I have a lot of experience in solving problems and creating new projects.

I really have knowledge of all programming languages ​​and tools. I no longer have an online page because internet providers always try to give you an IP that is 
already on the blacklist and I am not going to pay for anything since at first it worked well.

Project that is a reference in my work:
In 1998 I worked for a company in which they wanted to carry out bank reconciliations with payments for products and I commented that it was necessary for the banks 
to have an ID that would identify the payments that are made there, the bank reference was born.
